Communication between nodes:-
Publisher-Subscriber model
Nodes publish messages over a channel. Publishing and Subscribing is asynchronous in the sense that publishers and subscribers publish/subsrcribe at different frequencies.
Subscribers are event triggered and there is no acknowledgement of data reception to the publisher.
