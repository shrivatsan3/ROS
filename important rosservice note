while writing a server or publisher, a custom service data type is used.
Therefore it is important to build and execution dependencies in the package.xml file.
this tells catkin or ros to create the dependencies (the three clasees), during the build process and used during run time.

Also add the .srv file to the CMakeLists.txt file.
this is how catkin knows where to look for the file and what is the name of the custom service.
